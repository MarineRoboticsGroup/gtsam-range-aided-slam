# GTSAM Range-Aided SLAM

A straightforward solver for range-aided SLAM problems using the python bindings of GTSAM.

This library still is under development, and breaking changes may still occur.
However, this may be useful for others to use or to recreate some experimental
results obtained in our works.

This library makes use of our [PyFactorGraph Library](https://github.com/MarineRoboticsGroup/PyFactorGraph/)
to represent the SLAM problem. Installation is easy and described on the `PyFactorGraph` README page.
